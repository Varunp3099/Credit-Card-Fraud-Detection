# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project to detect credit card fraud using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for balancing the dataset and XGBoost for high-performance classification. Designed to address class imbalance and improve fraud prediction accuracy.

## Key Features:
*vReal-world credit card dataset (highly imbalanced)
* Data preprocessing with SMOTE for synthetic oversampling of minority (fraud) class
* XGBoost for robust, scalable fraud classification
* Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
* Confusion matrix and ROC Curve for performance visualization
* Model tuning with hyperparameter optimization
